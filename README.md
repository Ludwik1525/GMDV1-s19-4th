# Game Development - Project #4 - CatSplash
Fourth project for Game Development course. <br/>
The game is an arcade-style 2D game where the goal is to complete all the levels by getting to the finish while avoiding enemies. There is implemented highscor system which is persistent between game sessions, and so does the level progress. Some variables are stored in a config file so that they can be changed even for already built game.<br/>
Everything is done in Unity and uses C# for scripting.
